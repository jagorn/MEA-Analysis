# Use this file to specify:
# 1. which holographic stimuli were played during the experiment 
# 2. in which order they were displayed
# 3. all the conditions under which they were displayed (pharmacology, blockers, etc..)
# 4. other comments
# Use the following sintax:
#
# DH_FRAMES_FILE_NAME_1 (CONDITION1, CONDITION2, CONDITION3)  # COMMENTS 
# DH_FRAMES_FILE_NAME_2   # COMMENTS
# DH_FRAMES_FILE_NAME_3 (CONDITION1)  
# DH_FRAMES_FILE_NAME_4 (CONDITION1, CONDITION2) # COMMENTS
#
# the DH_FRAMES_FILE_NAME should correspond to an existing .mat frames file saved in the Holography folder.
# if during a session an unknown stimulus was played, use the keyword UNKNOWN.
#
#
# Example:
#
# DHFrames_20210403_1433 	(lap4, acet)
# DHFrames_20210403_1454 	(lap4, acet)
# DHFrames_20210403_1630	# pharmacology removed
